# Introduction
The heart is an indispensable muscular organ ensuring the bodies’ optimal functioning [1]. However, the global prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains a formidable challenge, contributing to nearly one-third of all recorded deaths worldwide. Among the spectrum of CVDs, Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) stands as a predominant threat [2]. A pivotal milestone in cardiovascular research, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) [3], was initiated in 1948 to identify risk factors associated with coronary heart disease. One noteworthy subset of the Framingham study, accessible on Kaggle, features 4,434 participants meticulously examined at three intervals spanning from 1956 to 1968, with a subsequent 24-year follow-up period. In this report, we construct the logistic regression model to delve into predicting the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease and explore the gender differences in the predictions, based on factors such as demographic information, lifestyle and behavioral habits, health conditions, and biomedical indicators.

# Methodology
## Study population
For the purpose of this study, all data and covariates were taken from the Framingham Heart Study conducted from 1956 to 1968. When exploring the data with our covariates of interest, we decide to work with only the complete cases since some variables have a significant amount of missing data. In such circumstances, imputation could lead to misestimation of the true variable distributions and relationships within the data, which will betray our priority of maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the raw data for prediction.

## Predictor(s) of Interest
Our predictors of interest were selected based on a comprehensive search of academic databases using terms like "Coronary heart disease," "Risk factors," and "Cardiovascular health" to find relevant studies. In numerous studies on age and CHD, it consistently highlights advancing age as a significant risk factor for CHD, with the risk increasing substantially after the age of 45–50 years [4]. There is evidence that suggests high blood pressure has been established as a major risk factor for CHD development [5]. Research conducted by Gallucci and team in 2020 [6] strongly associates smoking with an increased incidence of CHD, revealing that smokers face considerably higher risks. Similarly, Wilson's 1998 study [7] highlights that diabetes markedly raises the risk of developing CHD.

## Outcome
In our investigation, the ten-year risk of coronary heart disease (TenYearCHD) was focused on as the key outcome to assess CHD risk. This was designated as a binary variable: '0' indicates not being expected to develop coronary heart disease within the next ten years, while '1' implies being at risk of developing coronary heart disease within the same period. This binary classification stems from a variety of  risk factors, which we will delve into in the following section.

## Covariates
In our study exploring the predictors of the ten-year risk of coronary heart disease (TenYearCHD), a range of covariates were chosen, including aspects like demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits, clinical data, and individual health backgrounds. Among them, some are continuous and others are binary or categorical. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
We removed the incomplete cases and analyzed the data for complete cases based on the investigation of the study observations. First, the descriptive statistics for continuous variables such as age, smoking, cholesterol, and blood pressure is calculated. It illustrates mean values and standard deviations, indicating an average age of 49.56 years and 9.02 cigarettes smoked per day, as the example. Further, the descriptive statistics for binary and categorical variables for the same group is obtained, with percentages for gender, education, smoking status, medication use, and health conditions like hypertension and diabetes. For example, 44.37% are male and 55.63% are female, which indicates that the distribution between males and females is relatively balanced. In addition, 15.24% are at risk of coronary heart disease over ten years and 84.67% are not at risk, so the distribution suggests that a greater proportion of the sample is not at risk.

The box plots show that individuals who develop CHD in the next 10 years have higher mean ages, cholesterol levels, and mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures. We also analyzed the relationship between other risk factors and CHD. However, only whether current smoker and heart rate were found to be insignificantly correlated with CHD. Correlation analysis is performed to study the strength and direction of the relationships between response variable and potential covariates. It is also a crucial part in feature selection for predictive models, since highly correlated variables might provide redundant information and can be avoided to simplify models and improve their interpretability. From our analysis, there is a strong correlation at 0.77 between cigsPerDay and currentSmoker, and a strong correlation at 0.79 between diaBP and sysBP. As a result, in model building, we will only keep some of those variables.

# Logistic regression
Utilizing data from the Framingham Heart Study, logistic regression was employed to identify key risk factors associated with the development of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). The full model contains all covariates in the dataset.   

Full Model:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\log\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1 - \pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{male} + \beta_2 \times \text{age} + \beta_3 \times \text{education} + \beta_4 \times \text{currentSmoker} + \beta_5 \times \text{cigsPerDay} \\ 
+ \beta_6 \times \text{BPMeds} +   
\beta_7 \times \text{prevalentStroke} + \beta_8 \times \text{prevalentHyp} + \beta_9 \times \text{diabetes} + \beta_{10} \times \text{totChol} \\ 
+ \beta_{11} \times \text{sysBP} + \beta_{12} \times \text{diaBP} + \beta_{13} \times \text{BMI} + \beta_{14} \times \text{heartRate} + \beta_{15} \times \text{glucose} + \epsilon_i
\end{aligned}
$$
Potential interaction terms were selected based on literature review and were incorporated in our regression model. The coefficients and their significance were examined in new models. However, none of those coefficients were significant according to p-values. We also compared the models with and without interaction terms using anova( ). The results did not indicate a better fit when interaction terms were added. So, we may conclude that interaction terms should not be added to the model.  

Final Model:
$$
\log\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1 - \pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{male} + \beta_2 \times \text{age} + \beta_3 \times \text{cigsPerDay} + \beta_4 \times \text{totChol} + \beta_5 \times \text{sysBP} + \beta_6 \times \text{glucose} + \epsilon_i
$$

The final model was selected from the models without interaction terms using a combination of forward selection and backward elimination. We introduced the approaches taking p-value as a criteria. In the final model there were only six covariates. Covariates might be significantly associated with the response variable when examined individually, but might not be significant in the full model due to collinearity, interaction, sample size and so on.   
  
# Prediction  
To explore the gender differences in the predictions, we separated the data of males and females. In both of these datasets, we further divided the data into 70% training set and 30% test set, respectively. For the training set in both male and female data, we conduct model selection once more, commencing with the previously established final model and proceeding with backward elimination.   
Male Model:
$$
\log\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1 - \pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{age} + \beta_2 \times \text{cigsPerDay} + \beta_3 \times \text{totChol} + \beta_4 \times \text{sysBP} + \beta_5 \times \text{glucose} + \epsilon_i
$$
  
Female Model:
$$
\log\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1 - \pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{age} + \beta_2 \times \text{cigsPerDay} + \beta_3 \times \text{prevalentHyp} + \beta_4 \times \text{glucose} + \epsilon_i
$$

# Model Diagnosis
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width='25%', out.height='25%'}

knitr::include_graphics("qq.png")
```
Diagnostic plots depicted above indicate the inherent nature of the residuals following the logistic distribution. The Residual vs. Fitted plot shows two distinct groups, while the histogram of residuals plot shows that the residuals are clustered around 0 and 1. Due to the nature of binary outcome, we consider this as a normal situation to encounter when doing diagnostics plots for logistic regression. The partial regression plot shows patterns of random scatter for the independent variables, indicating that the relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the binary outcome is  approximately linear. There is an abrupt jump in the Q-Q plot, suggesting that there might be outliers that cause this deviation from the expected distribution.    

VIF was performed to check the collinearity, while we found no VIF values greater than 5. AIC was calculated to assess better fitting among models. Lower AIC was obtained for the final model, compared to the full model, indicating the final model being a better fit.

# Result  
In general, 6 covariates are predictive factors of CHD. The logistic regression model yielded insightful results, highlighting significant predictors contributing to CHD risk. Age (p < < 2e-16): Consistently emerged as a strong predictor, indicating a direct association between advancing age and increased CHD risk. Cigarettes per Day (p = 5.7e-12): Showed a statistically significant positive association with CHD occurrence. Systolic Blood Pressure (p = 1.2e-14): Systolic Blood pressure exhibited a moderate yet significant impact on CHD risk. Glucose  (p = 0.0018): Glucose demonstrated higher odds of developing CHD compared to non-smokers. For both male and female, age, cigsPerDay and glucose are predictive of CHD. For male, age, cigsPerDay, totChol, sysBP and glucose are predictive of CHD. For female, age, cisgPerDay, prevalentHyp, glucose are predictive of CHD.

# Shiny app
To visualize our prediction results, a Shiny app was built. The users can view and interact with our Shiny app via the link https://10yearchdprediction.shinyapps.io/625rshinyapp/. After entering personal information in the dashboard, the prediction of 10 year CHD Risk would appear in the instrument panels. The default interface is shown in figures above.

# Conclusion
The final attributes chosen following the elimination process exhibit p-values below 5%, which indicates their potential significance in predicting Heart disease. For Men, an Increase in age, number of cigarettes smoked per day and systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and glucose show increasing odds of having heart disease in the next 10 years. For women, an increase in age, number of cigarettes smoked per day, prevalence of hypertension and glucose show increasing odds of CHD. The model achieved an accuracy of 88% in its predictions for women and 80% accuracy for men. It leans toward being more specific than sensitive. To enhance the overall model performance, additional data could be beneficial. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions and lifestyle modifications to mitigate CHD risk. 

# Discussion
This study pinpointed key CHD risk factors like age and smoking, using historical data from the Framingham Heart Study. However, the reliance on older data limits its contemporary relevance. Future studies should utilize more current data and broaden their scope to include diverse populations, which would enhance the understanding and applicability of the findings. A longitudinal study design would be particularly valuable, offering insights into how these risk factors evolve over time and their long-term impact on CHD. Additionally, examining lifestyle factors in greater detail would provide a more comprehensive view of CHD prevention and management.
